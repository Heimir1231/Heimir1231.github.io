                Minecraft is a Video game created in 2009 by a now well known Markus persson or in minecraft known as "Notch".
                In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, 3D world with infinite terrain, and may discover and extract raw materials, 
                craft tools and items, and build structures or earthworks. Depending on game mode, players can fight computer-controlled 
                "mobs", as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode,
                in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited<br>
                <br>
                Players can modify the game to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets. When opening Minecraft we get an option for playing Single player, multiplayer and realms. Let me explain what they mean. Singleplayer: Singleplayer is minecraft but offline and by yourself. Multiplayer: Multiplayer is where you can join Servers and play with other people. Realms: Realms is like multiplayer but it is an invite only server, so that random people don´t join the game unless they have recieved an invitation <br>
                <br>
                There are many diffirent types of worlds you can explore in Minecraft. First off we have the Overworld. The Overworld is just normal. it has green trees, Blue seas, green grass and blue sky. just like the earth we live and breathe on. but when players create a portal to go to other worlds we got the nether portal. The Nether portal is created with obsidian and a flint & steel. when players create the portal and hop on through they spawn in a new world/Dimention. The Nether closely resembles how we would imagine Hell to be like. everything is on fire, seas of lava and Nether Fortresses. Nether Fortresses are huge castles generated in the nether that has a lot of loot and mobs. it is a great place of resources. And Lastly we have the End World. The End is a place only reachable through a stronghold that houses an End portal. players can not build Endportals like Netherportals. The End is like a final boss battle in video games. There are only 2 creatures that live in the end. there is the Enderman and The Ender Dragon. The ender dragon is Minecraft's Boss Battle. after defeating the Ender dragon players get a lot of EXP and loot, including the Dragon egg and the dragons Head.<br>
            <br>
            To stay alive in Minecraft players need to consume food and luckily there are alot of food resources in the game. There are the basic stuff like  meats(pork, Steak, chicken,bunny and even horse) and then there are also farmable resources like potatoes, that can be cooked and give you more protein, wheat that can be crafted into bread and carrots that can be turned into golden carrots. And when the player has a bit of a sweet tooth he/she can craft and eat cake or cookies. But there are also the poisenous foods, like rotten potato, raw chicken, rotten flesh and spider eyes.
